| Sept 24 |         8:45-9:15pm         |                                                                                                                                                                                        I tried brainstorming various solutions in class. I tried using maps. That felt too inefficient, so I tried using different types of graphs. |
| Sept 24 | 9:15 - 9:25am + 8:30-8:50pm |                                                                                                                                                                                        I tried using a hashmap or hashTree. I used a map to store the sorted Dictionary. I wanted to use a stack to keep track of misspelled words. |
| Sept 25 |         2:00-2:30pm         |                                                                                                                                             I am thinking of using a hashtable. Stacks aren't as good as queues or arraylists. I think that arraylists help store the order better than queues because we aren't removing anything. |
| Sept 25 |        2:30 - 3:00pm        |                                                                                                I just changed it to an array, and adjusted the for loops to add the words that were spelled incorrectly at the beginning of the sentence to be added in the beginning. I got three tests passing. I still tried brainstorming more. |
| Sept 25 |        4:00 - 4:30pm        |                                                                   I realized that checking in the array if a string word is already in the misSpelledWords arraylist was in linear, not constant time. I needed to find a way to check if its already misspelled and saved in constant time. Thus, I decided to use a map to do so. |
| Sept 25 |        4:30 - 5:00pm        | I used a map, added all the misspelled words to the map (as I was traversing text). I then checked the map (in constant time) whether or not it contained the misspelled word. If it didn't, only then did I add it to the arraylist. After that, I stored all the values of that arraylist into an array, and returned that array. |
| Sept 28 |        2:30-3:00 pm         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               I reviewed the class slides. I reviewed the pseudocode. I implemented the node class. |
| Sept 28 |         3:00-3:30pm         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           I implemented the trie class. I implemented the spellcheck clas. I ran the sentence test. |
| Sept 28 |          3:30-4pm           |                                                                                                                                                                        The alice test was failing. I debugged, and found the use of apostrophe. My code was only handling lowercase characters a - z or uppercase characters A - Z. |
| Sept 29 |         3 - 3:30pm          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                          I implemented punctuation string. It included possibile punctuation marks. The alice test started passing. |
| Sept 29 |          3:30-4pm           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                    I debugged the bard test. My code was failing for the word personae. It had the use of the special character ae. |
| Sept 29 |          4-4:30pm           |                                                                                                                          I realized my hardcoded punctuation string was not addressing all possible cases. I changed the node class. I used arraylist to allow for dynamic size of the arrays instead of using a traditional array. |
| Sept 29 |          4:30-5pm           |                                                                                                                                                                                                      I changed the trie class. I did this to allow for the dynamic size of next array list. The code was still failing on personae. |
| Sept 29 |          5-5:30pm           |                                                                                                 I searched how to to compare for unicode special characters in java. I used normalizer for the strings. I used codePointAt() instead of charAt(). I used int instead of char to do an arithmetic comparison for unicode characters. |
