| Sept 24 |         8:45-9:15pm         |                                                                                                                                                                                        I tried brainstorming various solutions in class. I tried using maps. That felt too inefficient, so I tried using different types of graphs. |
| Sept 24 | 9:15 - 9:25am + 8:30-8:50pm |                                                                                                                                                                                        I tried using a hashmap or hashTree. I used a map to store the sorted Dictionary. I wanted to use a stack to keep track of misspelled words. |
| Sept 25 |         2:00-2:30pm         |                                                                                                                                             I am thinking of using a hashtable. Stacks aren't as good as queues or arraylists. I think that arraylists help store the order better than queues because we aren't removing anything. |
| Sept 25 |        2:30 - 3:00pm        |                                                                                                I just changed it to an array, and adjusted the for loops to add the words that were spelled incorrectly at the beginning of the sentence to be added in the beginning. I got three tests passing. I still tried brainstorming more. |
| Sept 25 |        4:00 - 4:30pm        |                                                                   I realized that checking in the array if a string word is already in the misSpelledWords arraylist was in linear, not constant time. I needed to find a way to check if its already misspelled and saved in constant time. Thus, I decided to use a map to do so. |
| Sept 25 |        4:30 - 5:00pm        | I used a map, added all the misspelled words to the map (as I was traversing text). I then checked the map (in constant time) whether or not it contained the misspelled word. If it didn't, only then did I add it to the arraylist. After that, I stored all the values of that arraylist into an array, and returned that array. |
