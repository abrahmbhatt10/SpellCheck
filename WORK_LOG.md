| Sept 24 |         8:45-9:15pm         |                                                                                         I tried brainstorming various solutions in class. I tried using maps. That felt too inefficient, so I tried using different types of graphs. |
| Sept 24 | 9:15 - 9:25am + 8:30-8:50pm |                                                                                         I tried using a hashmap or hashTree. I used a map to store the sorted Dictionary. I wanted to use a stack to keep track of misspelled words. |
| Sept 25 |         2:05-2:35pm         |                                              I am thinking of using a hashtable. Stacks aren't as good as queues or arraylists. I think that arraylists help store the order better than queues because we aren't removing anything. |
| Sept 25 |        2:35 - 3:05pm        | I just changed it to an array, and adjusted the for loops to add the words that were spelled incorrectly at the beginning of the sentence to be added in the beginning. I got three tests passing. I still tried brainstorming more. |
