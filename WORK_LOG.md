| Sept 24   |         8:45-9:15pm         |                                                                                                                                                                                        I tried brainstorming various solutions in class. I tried using maps. That felt too inefficient, so I tried using different types of graphs. |
| Sept 24   | 9:15 - 9:25am + 8:30-8:50pm |                                                                                                                                                                                        I tried using a hashmap or hashTree. I used a map to store the sorted Dictionary. I wanted to use a stack to keep track of misspelled words. |
| Sept 25   |         2:00-2:30pm         |                                                                                                                                             I am thinking of using a hashtable. Stacks aren't as good as queues or arraylists. I think that arraylists help store the order better than queues because we aren't removing anything. |
| Sept 25   |        2:30 - 3:00pm        |                                                                                                I just changed it to an array, and adjusted the for loops to add the words that were spelled incorrectly at the beginning of the sentence to be added in the beginning. I got three tests passing. I still tried brainstorming more. |
| Sept 25   |        4:00 - 4:30pm        |                                                                   I realized that checking in the array if a string word is already in the misSpelledWords arraylist was in linear, not constant time. I needed to find a way to check if its already misspelled and saved in constant time. Thus, I decided to use a map to do so. |
| Sept 25   |        4:30 - 5:00pm        | I used a map, added all the misspelled words to the map (as I was traversing text). I then checked the map (in constant time) whether or not it contained the misspelled word. If it didn't, only then did I add it to the arraylist. After that, I stored all the values of that arraylist into an array, and returned that array. |
| Sept 28   |        2:30-3:00 pm         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               I reviewed the class slides. I reviewed the pseudocode. I implemented the node class. |
| Sept 28   |         3:00-3:30pm         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           I implemented the trie class. I implemented the spellcheck clas. I ran the sentence test. |
| Sept 28   |          3:30-4pm           |                                                                                                                                                                        The alice test was failing. I debugged, and found the use of apostrophe. My code was only handling lowercase characters a - z or uppercase characters A - Z. |
| Sept 29   |         3 - 3:30pm          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                           I implemented punctuation string. It included possible punctuation marks. The alice test started passing. |
| Sept 29   |          3:30-4pm           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                    I debugged the bard test. My code was failing for the word personae. It had the use of the special character ae. |
| Sept 29   |          4-4:30pm           |                                                                                                                          I realized my hardcoded punctuation string was not addressing all possible cases. I changed the node class. I used arraylist to allow for dynamic size of the arrays instead of using a traditional array. |
| Sept 29   |          4:30-5pm           |                                                                                                                                                                                                      I changed the trie class. I did this to allow for the dynamic size of next array list. The code was still failing on personae. |
| Sept 29   |          5-5:30pm           |                                                                                                 I searched how to to compare for unicode special characters in java. I used normalizer for the strings. I used codePointAt() instead of charAt(). I used int instead of char to do an arithmetic comparison for unicode characters. |
| October 2 |          6-6:30pm           |                                                                                                                                                                        I brainstormed a bit. I realized that a problem came up when I was inserting. It is vital to keep track of the word index and what node you're currently at. |
| October 2 |          6:30-7pm           |                                                                                                                                                                                                            I tried printing out all of the nodes. I had trouble conceptualizing the logic. I debated to use recursion or iteration. |
| October 2 |          7:30-8pm           |                                                                                                                                                                                             I was stuck. I decided to use iteration, because recursion had too many bugs. I created a while loop instead of using a recursive call. |
| October 3 |          5-5:30pm           |                                                            The setting of the parent/previous node to the new inserted nodes with the right index was problematic. I had to keep track of existing node versus the next pointer node. I simplified the logic of inserting the remaining characters once I found an insertion point. |
| October 3 |          5:30-6pm           |                                               The function insert remaining was not setting the index of the pointers correctly. I debugged this function several times to make sure insert was working properly. The insert of a single letter word when it already existed was not setting the last isWord() parameter correctly. |
| October 3 |          6-6:30pm           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                           I debugged lookup(). It wasn't working. I ran the debugger and corrected checks for the last letter word. |
| October 3 |          6:30-7pm           |                                                                                                                                                                                        The insertion of 'ban' after ball wasn't working. It was inserting the 'a' again. It should have created a new branch directly at n instead. |
| October 4 |        11:00-11:30am        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                I debugged through the different cases. My results were 20, not 24. Some misspelled words were not getting inserted. | 
| October 4 |        11:30am-12pm         |                                                                                                                  I debugged through the insertion and lookup. I tried to understand where the code was going wrong. I realized that I was inserting at the matched character and not at the next null to getCurrentNode() function. |
